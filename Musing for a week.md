**WEEK – 6th to 11th September 

# SEPTEMBER Musings

## Monday
Snakes and Ladders was always a go-to game in my childhood. I don’t remember the box that housed it when it was new. I only remember the battered and fraying edges – well-worn and well-loved when mum decided to give it away to the children of the house help we had at the time – Narmada ben. As with everything I have trouble letting go of, I remember the reluctance with which I handed it over. I remember the battered board – half torn at the spine. It was reversible. Snakes and Ladders on one side and Ludo on the other. I played Ludo with my parents but Snakes and Ladders by myself (as me and my imaginary friends who changed as time went along). I would never bring that box out whenever mum asked me to hang out with our neighbor’s child, Aashna who was 3 years younger to me and could not be trusted to maintain the sanctity of the box or treat it with care. 

## Tuesday
I was 6 when I think I truly understood the concept of winning and losing. Winning meant rewards in the form of a chocolate or a sweet in the house. Losing meant cleaning your room, putting away toys in accordance with the strict organization my mum maintained in the household. Winning and losing were embodied in Snakes and Ladders. Going up the ladder meant internal cheering - one-upping mum and getting my hands on that sugar rush. Sliding down the snake meant disappointment, setbacks, and being left behind while my parents got ahead. By luck or by design, I lost more than I won in Snakes and Ladders – one of the main reasons I stopped playing with them.

## Wednesday
I liked playing it as multiple versions of myself. That way it no longer was about the journey of my individual self with its triumphs and losses. Even if one version of me got eaten by the snake – the other would eventually make it. I also remember being pissed off by the dice. Even then, I disliked the bit about handing over control to this little plastic cube. How dare it decided how many steps I moved ahead or not? I sometimes saw the board and would add additional gimmicks of my own. For example: If I saw a six on the dice and that would lead me to a snake, I would club 3 dots on the dice as 1 so as a result had to move forward only two paces. I alternated between following the edicts of the dice and clubbing as I went along to suit my purpose. 

## Thursday
I clearly did not prescribe to the Karmic model of the game which I know of now. Had I not played the sanitized and numbered British version but the older realmic version as seen in Jain and Mughal representations, I would have loved my 6-year-old self to come up with interpretations of what those meant and how to bypass them. And looking back at my tendencies, the game which spoke of binaries would have most definitely pronounced me morally grey with my habit of making my way around the rules to win regardless of whether it was fair or not. 

## Friday
I can’t say for sure, but I think Snakes and Ladders gave birth to my fascination with obstacles courses. I internalized it and made it part of my inner fortress and landscape. Before anyone reached the moat that surrounded the said estate, they would go through a Snakes and Ladder style course which determined how close they got to me – if at all. And depending on where they reached, different aspects of me would become visible to them. The board wasn’t dual or simple here. It was more like Hagrid’s hedge in the third task of the Triwizard tournament meets Wipeout and Legends of the Hidden Temple. 

## Saturday
I like this board. Mainly because of the two scorpions added. What do they do? Do they bite, inject a slow-acting poison, and make it more difficult to get ahead? Not to mention the two ladders that defy its own straight nature to turn at strange obtuse angles to get where they need to. Also, those flowers on number 23. They come after the scorpions so they could be anything between a wreath on your gravestone to a possible anecdote that counteracts the scorpion poison.

## Sunday
This Vaishnava 72 square board hailing from 1780s Lucknow was commissioned by a British official Richard Johnson and is currently in the British Library. According to Topsfield, apparently the end game is to reach not number 72 but 68 which is right in the middle of the top row – which though not marked visually is supposed to be the ‘Heaven of Vishnu’. It is meant to be played cyclically. Known across north India as gyan chaupar, "the chaupar of knowledge (jnana)", or gyan bazi, "game of knowledge", Snakes and Ladders was not only a pastime or diversion but had an edifying, instructive purpose. Its theme was no less than the spiritual quest for liberation from the bondage of karma and the hindrances of the passions. The players' pieces would progress, according to the throw of dice or cowry shells, from states of illusion, worldly vices, or hells in the lower squares of the board, to ever higher realms of consciousness, the various heavens, and so ultimately to Enlightenment or union with the Supreme.
