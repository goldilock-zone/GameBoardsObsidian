**Ecosophical Aesthetics: Art, Ethics and Ecology with Guattari**

*Edited by Patricia MacCormack, Colin Gardner*

In this structure, Skeet undertakes a close reading of the Meditations using Guattari's three levels of processual practice:

1. **Modular crystallizations**: The set of procedures with which the poet tears language apart, all the better to rearrange it as continuous variation. 

2. **Polyphonic fabulous images**: The expressive remix of heterogeneous components.

3. **Existential operators**: The production of new subjectivities.

We move, via Joris's deterritorialization of language, from the imaginary to the real, from a "verbalizing fabulation" to the creation of "fabulous images" that produce a post-media poetics midway between the pragmatic and speculative trajectories of Guattari's politics of immanence.

### Modular Crystallizations

At this level, language constitutes an expressive materiality exceeding any communicative function. In the Meditations sequence, certain procedures are used to create "atomic constructions" within language (Cockelbergh 2011: 129). Words inside other words are revealed, as in 'the awe is in gawking' (Doris 2013: 14) of the first line of the second poem in the sequence. Omission and/or addition of single letters can transform one word into another, so 'scares' in the third line of the same poem becomes 'care' in the fifth and 'scars' in the seventh. Rhyme and rhythm also foreground the relations between words, a relation, according to Doris, "That is not / in the thing or the it I but between the two / it's the relation a I we can be" (14). In the fourth poem of the sequence (16), this breaking of Joris's 'atomic constructions' treks words as asignifying material, plugging into and manipulating language as modular. As with the refraction of light through crystal that moves in differing directions at once, this modularity generates polysemous routes through the poetry, linking and relinking its parts in different ways. The idea of modularity is central to Guattari's (2013: 2) concept of machinic subjectivity, operable across a range of domains: 'technical, biological, semiotic, logical, abstract'. The machinic and its fundamental modularity is thus support for "proto-subjective processes" (2); that is, building blocks are exposed that put subjectivity onto new lines of transformation. The modular crystallizations identified in Joris's poem likewise place reading onto lines of continuous variation.

### Polyphonic Fabulous Images

According to Guattari (2013, 225), 'fabulous images' form through dissimilar universes of reference colliding and referring to Bakhtin entertaining "dialogic relations," their convergence enlarging fields of virtuality and producing "a surplus value of sense, a supplement of singularity, an existential taking consistency." In the Meditations sequence, a notable example of this process is the fabulous image of the pocket. Through its mixture of heterogeneous components as it repeats in different ways across the series, the image of the pocket becomes a component of expression ensuring poems in the series constantly echo each other. These echoes take place across a spectrum of references generated by the image, transversally connected. In the first poem (Doris 2013: 13), what could be 

### Existential Operators

At this level, the poem becomes a process that 'puts in place a new type of enunciation and, as a consequence, a new subjective production' (Guattari 2013: 228). It is a process Guattari refers to as 'synaptic' since it operates at psychic and social levels simultaneously. According to Guattari, this process takes place in Genet's work through the 'narrative graft of a religious origin' onto the fabulous image so that it functions auto-poetically, entirely for itself, making available a surplus of "processual power" (229). An existential operation, in this regard, marks an opening to the infinite; as synapse it 'initiates a self-enunciative procedure through its character as a caesura, as a-signifying catalysis' (189). 

This poem functions within the sequence of poems as an existential operation producing surplus value: attuned to the particular correspondence of cultures across time and space that Joris draws attention to, an opening is made to the infinite possibility of 'a break with what came before / a new rule, another splendour' that affirms a power of construction, that is, the possibility to get a hold on the process of production of subjectivity. According to Guattari (2013: 189), the existential operator marks the point after which "something will never return," the crossing of a threshold and institution of an irreversibility of the process. The poem ends by insisting on the enduring significance of
