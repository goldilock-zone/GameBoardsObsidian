   - Once you reach the center, you can combine a Cosmic Metaphor with a Reality Canvas to unleash your creative potential and declare victory.

8. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to successfully combine a Cosmic Metaphor with a Reality Canvas at the "Canvas of Reality" wins the game.
   - If multiple players reach the center on the same turn, they must compete in a creative challenge, with Enigma Tokens as currency, to determine the ultimate winner.
