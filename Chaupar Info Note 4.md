Everyday Chaupar boards are made of fabric and have four arms that are stitched or otherwise connected to the sides of a central rectangle. The majority are produced by local tailors and come in a wide range of styles, fabrics, and designs, with a hundred variations in between, and have been linked to the state, district, or tribe. Technical details are also subject to variation. Three squares per arm are normally crosscut as safe squares on any Chaupar board. The distribution of such squares is surprisingly fluid, with at least twenty-three different layouts found across the country. The dome-shaped playing pieces, which depict a minaret or a woman's breast, are made of painted wooden, bone, ivory, glass, beads, semi-precious stones, valuable stones, crystal, brass, silver, and gold (and no doubt other media). Long or stick dice, known locally as pasas, have traditionally been fashioned of wood, glass, metals, bone, or ivory, with numerals conveyed by a dot-and-ring and numbers on two opposite faces adding up to seven (1:6, 2:5, 3:4).
