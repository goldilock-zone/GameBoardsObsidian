**Indie-futurisms spotlight the sites of interventions and participation where flights for futural imagination are taken every day. Independent of history, these Indie-Futurisms potentially exist in sites of production, sites of storage, sites of participation and sites of indeterminacy. 

Indie-futurisms are events - those that only become possible when multiple networks are traced and overlaid through a rigorous de-stratification and re-stratification to create a plane of entanglement. On this plane of entanglement, potential exists.  

We offer our first demonstrations of indie-futurisms on traditional Indian board games. The emergence of the game-boards as game-worlds happen through a recombinant methodology of world-building for indie-futures developed through designed encounters of selected board games with both conventional and non-conventional methods of worlding.  

These game-worlds demonstrate in miniature their own networked ecologies of the communities, material culture, obscure paraphernalia, and inter-connected geographies. Selected traditional Indian board games are unpacked as Indie-futurist machines which generate shifting subjectivities for multiple futures. These subjectivities in turn become indie-futuring machines. Through the project, we demonstrate subjectivities as the  pre-personal stage of emergent citizenships for multiple futures. 

Indie-futurisms re-balance dynamic structures of thought to mount multiple futures by scaffolding multiple histories.
