#dice
Chaupar is a cross and circle family of games played in India, believed to be created around the 4th Century. It gained popularity as a gambling game played by the kings of India, especially Mughal's, who was very fond of it. Again, going back to the gameplay, as discussed previously the three dices used for playing, this game can also be played using six cowry shells. The author here remembers himself always playing with the cowry shells. The cowry shells are used to play a variety of moves, the face-up or face down resembles the number of steps the player can move, for example, if they all face down = 6, 1 face-up = 10 (one bonus square move or awaken a new pawn), 2 face-up = 2, 3 face-up = 3, 4 face-up = 4, 5 face-up = "8" (25 square moves with one bonus square or awaken new pawn), 6 face-up = 12. Here, an extra turn is granted by playing a 6, 12, 10 or "8" (25 square move). It is not allowed to fix the cowry shells before throwing them. This is cheating and is known as "Bandhana". The cowry shells are usually thrown in 3 styles: either by sliding them, throwing them in the air with one cowry placed on the index finger (which is thrown higher) or by spinning them in the hand.
