“Rahul anna! Oru dayam pota, namma win pakka” (Rahul anna! Put one and we will win for sure). The bet was intense and we had to beat the opposition party. We win an unlimited orange candy treat from Nandini’s one-month pocket savings, something we were desperately waiting for! 

  

Summer holidays began with such bets and it was critical to pick up the Daya-Katta (Pachisi) vocabulary. My grandpa’s courtyard was my Tamil class. Playing with my cousins and neighbors is how I learned the language. You had to know the keywords or else one wrong move and the team takes a heavy blow. Onnu (one) Errangi (two fives), Vetti (killing the opposite team’s pawn), were the first words I learned.  

  
#dice
An ideal(why ideal?) game of dice;  Pachisi; is a team of four sitting at four sides of the chalk-drawn board on the red-oxide floor.(This is great as an exceptional board- usually they are more portable)  We had an exception. We were a team of two in each team making it eight players in total. Satya akka my constant teammate for a pro in rolling the dice for doubles (why is rolling doubles significant?) and I would put twos and fours for safe play (what makes it safe play?). Mukunda anna and my neighbor kid Balaji anna would always team up and cheat on us.(How do you cheat in pachisi? How did Mukunda Anna and Balaji cheat?) They were the first ones to lose the game and eventually lose the bet in most cases.

  

Most of our conversations during the game would be strategies(do you remember what these strategies were like?) to keep our pawn safe but occasionally we used to talk about the village carnivals, some old age beliefs (Like?), and scary ghost stories of some abandoned wells at the end of the village. Pachisi can definitely take the credit for my history love as most of our bets would be to explore those forbidden lanes of the village which had many hidden treasures.

  

My grandfather’s village(write name) has water scarcity, something most of the villages in Tamil Nadu face. I never knew the seriousness of it until Nandini told us about it in one of our games and that’s when we decided to try a simple drip irrigation technique from our science project. We got a small PVC pipe that connected at the roof where the water otherwise just flowed down. We managed to fix it using small twines from our back garden and put it in place. At the end of the pipe, we put a small bucket. We managed to collect half bucket water for the next three days when it rained a little and used it for the jasmine plant. 

  

Pachisi was not just a game but an arena of opportunities how small or big they might be. Every game was a new learning experience and I made new friends. For instance,  Our neighbors were weavers and Jyothi akka and Ravi anna let us into their workshop and showed us how it works. Are there more such experiences?

  

We were a gang of 20 members running all over the place playing games, chasing chickens, and sometimes rolling in the mud with our while clothes on. My gang has my sister Soundharya, my cousins Nandini, Bhushan, Satya, Mukunth, Rahul, Radhika, Shilpa, Gayatri and our neighbors Jyothi akka, Ravi anna, Balaji anna and Murali uncle and my uncles Sampath and Balu would join us for a game or two and it would be all
