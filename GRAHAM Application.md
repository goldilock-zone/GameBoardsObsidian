## Title

**Sites of Indie-Futurisms: Traditional Board Games of India**

## One-Sentence Description of Your Project

This project leads to an illustrated scholarly monograph using speculative world-building to catalogue traditional Indian board games as enmeshed ecologies of sites of production, sites of participation, and sites of generation of multiple Indie-futurisms.

## Project Abstract

This project spotlights the sites of interventions and participation where flights for futural imagination are taken every day. Independent of history, these Indie-Futurisms potentially exist in sites of production, sites of storage, sites of participation and sites of indeterminacy.

This project uses speculative design research methods, focusing on subjective and qualitative knowledge systems to turn to an under-examined area of study: Traditional Indian board games as narrative environments. Kreedakaushalya archives in Mysuru, India holds many of these game-boards, and a layered understanding of their narratives is developed through closely studying their 35 years of communities of, within and around these games.

The game-worlds demonstrate in miniature their own networked ecologies of the communities, material culture, obscure paraphernalia, and inter-connected geographies. These traditional narrative environments are unpacked as Indie-futurist machines which generate shifting subjectivities for multiple futures. Indie-futurisms re-balances dynamic structures of thought to mount multiple futures by scaffolding multiple histories.

## Project Impact

Games have been inherently speculative in nature and always rely on their players' subjective participation, strategic intervention, and leaps of imagination. Traditional Indian board games rely on strategic play within multiplayer modalities. These modalities spore forms of engagement ranging from dialogue to debate to discourse in order to move across the board. Highly structural and causal in nature, these engagements are also mirrored in the material, mental, and social ecologies that have produced these games. This project will closely examine the craft-cultures, political acumen, aesthetic agendas, and community-making ambitions of the society enmeshed on the sites of these board games. This study projects the speculations born from the game-worlds to their sites of production, transference, and participation to understand the game as the central artefact to produce worlds born from the logics and rules of the game. It asks a pointed question - How can the games we play change the citizens we become?

If our understanding of the game-board as a site of traditional knowledge systems is shifted to it being a machine to produce future thought processes, communities, and worlds, what kind of transformations will our traditional games need to undergo?

## Project Statement

Meta-history is above; under-history is below. In trying to move from an epic history of select practices and grand narratives, we saw a growing need to acknowledge the other forms of transforming the worlds which often seem invisible – supporting characters perhaps, but also necessary supports for the future of everyday life in India. With this intention, we began to engage with game-ecologies as sites for making futures.

Game boards are also sites of pleasure, sites of risk, sites of leisure, sites of intellectual engagement, and sites of socialization. Experiences get grounded within a designed play - engagement with a series of rules, constraints, and possibility in order to navigate across these sites to reach a desired end. Game-plays are thus microcosms of potential worlds, and architectural imperative towards understanding sites as worlds. These game-plays also encode within them conventions and boundaries of inhabitation within the game-worlds.

Within these same games, the bubbling under-histories and latent Indie-futurisms are already present. This produces a conflated time within the game-worlds - made of both cyclic and linear time synchronically. Participation in these worlds require a becoming subjectivity that is liberated from the teleological notion of time. Can this becoming subjectivity be recreated outside these game-worlds? Can non-teleological worlds be generated, through game-play, outside of their own sites of production? Are these processes transferable and transformable?

This humanistic multi-modal research is fundamentally an additive process to tackle some of such questions. This is also significant towards decolonising the idea of speculative world-building within the Indian subcontinent. We will necessarily re-historicize and de-colonize some of the existing narratives and histories to liberate other forms of embedded wisdom and wonder located in historical gameplay, its codes, its denotations and connotations, the circle of influences from the game board to individual imaginations. This project also seeks to diversify the imagination of Indian pasts from its religious, nationalist and labour-specific connotations. It documents a fascinating path, moving from Indo-futurism to Indie-futurisms, of decolonization that is not subtractive, but rather synthesizing in its core tendencies, to imagine harmonic, polyphonic and playful futures, from everyday imaginariums.

## ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

Through the grants to individuals program, the Graham Foundation wants to contribute to the creative, intellectual, and professional growth of individuals and support them at crucial or potentially transformative stages in their careers. Given that Graham Foundation grants are both limited and competitive, please explain why support would be pivotal at this particular point in your career or for this particular project. (200 words)

Both authors of this project, through their design work as well as their current doctoral projects explore world-building, ludic interactions and its agency to spore serendipitous events deliberately beyond the humanistic agency. Ludic world-building often highlights chance and possibilities outside of power, control and rigid identity formations, making this approach of engaging with the leisure time even more desirable in the increasingly fundamentalist political climate. Their projects take the form of community engagement with vulnerable, disadvantaged and often under-represented communities, many of whom don't qualify for the current fashionable "_____ lives matter" campaigns and therefore receive no financial support. On the other end, the development of methodologies "on the ground" also edifies their teaching endeavours - ensuring that the emerging design students get exposure to content as well as methodology that are excluded from the extremely dated design curriculum in the Indian subcontinent. Support from the Graham Foundation will provide the authors the means to tell stories that need to be heard, rather than those the world expects to hear. This urgent project, if funded, will grant legitimacy to the narrative-based community engagement strategies the authors have been developing to deliver unexpected powerful stories to the widest audiences possible.

## Who is the intended audience for this project? (200 words)

Board games come with their own audiences; they are informal public commons connecting people. As such, they also act like an ecosystem for possible change. At the center are the billions of Indians who cherish these board games both as play, as well as memories of their everyday childhood. Around the play spaces are the makers of these games - in a concentric circular diagram - the creative artisans that materialize, visualize, and design these games; the investors/patron, who value the latent possibilities of the games; and now the researchers, who study the implications and applications of the games and their worlds. Our project intends to interact with each of the concentric circles through deliberately selected diverse mediums. We also hope that through careful explication, we are able to influence how each of the players in these concentric circles can form new and perhaps unexpected relationships with each other to spore new knowledge ecologies through these game worlds.

## Beyond the expected research outcomes, describe the hope for what the project will ultimately do, the envisioned final form, and how these goals will be achieved. (200 words)

This project reaches out to a large and multi-faceted community of people across all sectors of society who remember, play, and will learn these fascinating traditional board games - not only think about games and their corresponding worlds, but also about the everyday world through games. This is imagined to take the form of decentralised and decolonized approach to the intellectual systems circumscribing the serious play. As we will examine this condition through a series of mediums, languages, and positionalities, we intend to disseminate insights and outcomes to an inclusive range of audiences in a selective range of media. This approach consciously mirrors the diversity of the audiences that engage in the necessity of play in everyday life. For this research we identify outward-facing future publications, exhibitions, and installations as outcomes essentially for community participation, in alignment with the Graham Foundation expertise. In parallel, we also propose to work at the grassroots to design and gift discrete summaries and infographic cards, flyers, and game inserts as supplemental "take-away" multilingual materials for these audiences.

## UPDATE TO PROJECT IMPACT

As the phase one of this year's Graham Foundation grants were being processed, India experienced a chilling shift in her freedom of speech and expression through a series of shifts in governing preferences as well as lack of judicial diligences. The otherwise protected world of childhood and play did not escape this surveillance, either.

Narendra Modi in his national address on August 30, 2020 'Mann ki Baat' mentioned the "great potential and opportunity that can be tapped to promote 'Aatma Nirbhar Indian Toys'". This was followed up by the mygov.in portal to launch a national "Atmanirbhar Toy Innovation Challenge" on December 4, 2020 to "encourage the Indians to design toy-based games based on Indian tradition, culture, heritage, mythological stories and characters." The results of this are yet to be announced. One of the alarming evaluation criteria is that the toys "must reflect Indian culture and traditions." Modi, in his address, referred to the impact of this toy-making as the emergence of "Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat" (One India, Great India). It must be remembered that "One" here is defined by the ideological apparatus of the current ruling party - that has been insidiously and consistently sidelining all but upper caste Hindu culture from national consideration.

Design Industry and education both responded to this call in the first week of February through "Ahmedabad Design Week 2021" - teaching and making "Indian" toys and games as yet another mediation towards the extreme Hindu nationalism of the current government.

Children play games to make sense of their social and cultural worlds. This is also how at a young age, they form a political unconscious. This soft appropriation of the game world in service of the production of "One India" spotlights the urgency of this project. The larger agenda of this project, keeping in mind the recent developments, is to now protect the child-like imagination that gets developed through play, games, and practices that contain within them polyphonic worlds, and therefore contribute to the production of multiple imaginaries for the future, not just "One".

1. **Title: Immanence: Through Sharmanka Kinetic Theatre**

   Bibliographic citation - Jain, Ishita. 2020. "Immanence." Vesper. Rivista di architettura, arti e teoria | Journal of Architecture, Arts & Theory.

   Relationship to proposed project:

   Sharmanka through its semi-gothic carnivalesque production demonstrates the presence of "immanence", the interval between "worlds"—collaboratively, politically, ethically—in order to contribute to a decolonization of the many worlds from the imposition of the "one world".

   The ethics for a pluriversal and decolonized world-building was germane in this scholarly essay. This project highlights the author's commitment to develop world-building practices for fluid and multiple subject formations outside of rigid socio-political norms. Moreover, this essay also demonstrates the ability of the author to generate multiple outtakes from a single research project, of a form different than its original conception to another set of audience.

2. **Title: Erospheres: What forms of love are available to a Museum today?**

   Venue: Glasgow Science Centre, Glasgow, UK
   Date: November 2021

   Relationship to proposed project:

   This project speculates that all forms of being in the world are guided by the forms of love that are available in an era. In order to transform the ways of engaging in the world, forms of love and forms of care that are available need to transform as well. It sets the search for answers within a speculative world where the available dimension of love is negotiated by a Little Organization of Virtuous Ecologies (L.O.V.E.) that deploys a range of scientific-poetic affects (called Erospheres) into the world.

   Our stall - like in a climate change expo is proposed to be set up as a parody - highlighting the absurdity that gets generated when the conversations about growth, development, and well-being are wrapped in only economic vocabulary. This parody will highlight the need to talk about nurture versus control, where growth is concerned. Post-economic development should reach the last person standing through vertical, diagonal, and spiral paths. Well-being must be claimed as rightfully ours, and not something that has to be given.

   This project demonstrates both the ability of both the authors to work collectively towards conceptualisation of design fictions as narrative environments in such a way that complex and entangled wicked problems are made performative for the participants to make sense of. It also showcases the authors' command over diverse fields like spatial story-telling, theatrical scripting, visual illustrations, and dramaturgy - all the while keeping in mind the context of the event, namely climate change, which gets reflected in its found objects design aesthetic.

3. **Title: Setting Sail: Documentation of Indigenous knowledge systems of Shipmaking in Mandvi, Kutch**

   Venue: Mandvi, Kutch, Gujarat, India
   Date: January 2019

   Relationship to proposed project:

   'Setting Sail' was a relative study program that documented the indigenous ship-building practices and forms of handmade wooden ships made in Mandvi, Kutch in India.
