### Aberrant Nuptials: Deleuze and Artistic Research
*Edited by Paulo de Assis, Paolo Giudici*

The third and final moment is when the images themselves become "existential operators"—what Guattari calls "incorporeal universes" of discussion whose function is to produce a singularity. This is why a specific way of talking about "subjectivity" (Guattari 1995, 129). This operation, "freedom or might we say here fictioning—operates as what Guattari calls in *The "Production of Subjectivity"* a "possible existential catalyst" (Guattari 1995, 109). As he goes on to remark, this can't be "confined in the mists of scriptural, visual, musical or plastic disjunctives" where it "engages quasi-synchronically the enunciative crystallisation of the creator, the interpreter and the admirer of the work of art, like analyst and patient" (ibid). Guattari's argumentation and, indeed, larger aesthetic paradigm involves both maker and participant in this production of a different kind of subjectivity: "Its efficiency lies in its capacity to promote addictive, possessive ruptures within semiotically structured, significational and denotative networks, where it will put emergent subjectivity to work" (ibid).

In relation to mimesis we might then say that fabulous images, ultimately, involve a prescription of a world (or even a prescription of a prescription) — they have the signifying content—[but] they also operate to disrupt a given world. Indeed, the point of disruption is also the point around which a different subjectivity, and thus their world, might begin to gather (non-sense can produce new forms of sense). “A singularity, a rupture in sense, a cut, a fragmentation, the detachment of a semiotic content—out of a deterritorialising manner—can originate mutant nuclei of subjectivation” (Guattari 1995, 115) As Guattari goes on to remark: "In studies on new forms of art (like Deleuze's on cinema) we will see, for example, movement-images and time-images constituting the seeds of the production of subjectivity" (ibid).

In the essay on Genet, Guattari (1995) also writes about a kind of "self-fashioning"—or, "self-divinization" (ibid)—that proceeds from these points: "a page limit the extension of entropy” (ibid), the release of new constellations of universes of reference" (ibid). This is then less the mirroring back of a subjectivity already in place than a kind of abstract deterritorialisation of the latter and, as with Deleuze, calling forth something differential: "Relations are now entirely abstract; less phenomenological—however tempting it may be to reduce them to Oedipus and incest. Inflected, much much more molecular if the pro- tomorrow of images, but finds itself clothed in new no longer addresses itself to, but will develop and horizon itself with the energy, psychoanalytical work, is made from what is to face"). From this stage, the Foucaultian motif and eschatological horizon is as it provides what might manner must conjoin a fetishmaking of life). For here the book is kind of asechoic political and practical fictioning. And then, as for poetic function manifest for the other art—as fictioning—introduces and helps produce a new subjectivity alongside those words appropriate and adequate to it.
