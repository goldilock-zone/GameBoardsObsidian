There are many names for the game of Chaupar, some local as well as some Westernized.  One of these names is Pachisi; Chaupar is said to be either an ancestor of Pachisi's game or originated at the same time as Pachisi with a nearly identical game rule. It is the use of long dice as opposed to cowries that is most significant in distinguishing the Chaupar and Pachisi. "The poor man's Chaupar," as Pachisi was dubbed. This is partially because cowries (the playing pieces in Pachisi) were used like cash by the lower Indian classes, and partly because Chaupar is a more complicated game, and hence more aristocratic. The game "Ludo" is a popular Westernized and simplified version of this game. The historical names of these games are noteworthy, as Pachisi means "twenty-five" in Hindi, which is the highest score that can be achieved with a single dice throw. Chaupar, on the other hand, is a representation of the traditional board's four arms.
