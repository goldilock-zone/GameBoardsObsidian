**A THOUSAND PLATEAUS - Glossary**

- **AFFECT/AFFECTION:** Neither word denotes a personal feeling (sentiment in Deleuze and Guattari). Laffect (Spinoza’s affectus) is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body’s capacity to act. Laffection (Spinoza’s affectio) is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include “mental” or ideal bodies).

- **DRAW:** In A Thousand Plateaus, to draw is an act of creation. What is drawn (the Body without Organs, the plane of consistency, a line of flight) does not preexist the act of drawing. The French word tracer captures this better: It has all the graphic connotations of “to draw” in English but can also mean to blaze a trail or open a road. “To trace” (decalquer), on the other hand, is to copy something from a model.

- **FLIGHT/ESCAPE:** Both words translate fuite, which has a different range of meanings than either of the English terms. Fuite covers not only the act of fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, and disappearing into the distance (the vanishing point in a painting is a point de fuite). It has no relation to flying.

- **MILIEU:** In French, milieu means “surroundings,” “medium” (as in chemistry), and “middle.” In the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, “milieu” should be read as a technical term combining all three meanings.

- **PLANE:** The word plan designates both a “plane” in the geometrical sense and a “plan.” The authors use it primarily in the first sense. Where both meanings seem to be present (as in discussions of the, plan d’organisatori), “plan(e)” has been used in the translation.

- **POWER:** Two words for “power” exist in French, puissance and pouvoir. In Deleuze and Guattari, they are associated with very different concepts. Puissance refers to a range of potential, analogous to the capacity of a number to be raised to a higher “power.” It is used in the French translation of Nietzsche’s term “will to power.” Pouvoir, on the other hand, is used in a sense very close to Foucault’s, as an instituted and reproducible relation of force, a selective concretization of potential.

- **PROCESS/PROCEEDING:** The authors employ two words normally translated as “process.” Processus in their usage is the more general of the two, covering both the stratified and destratified dimensions of an occurrence. Proces pertains only to the stratification. In standard French, proces also means “trial” (as in the title of the Kafka novel). Deleuze and Guattari exploit this polysemy as a way of emphasizing the role of organizations of social power and regimes of signs in operations constitutive of the subject, or proces de subjectivation.

- **SELF:** Both Moi and Soi have usually been translated as “Self.” Soi is the self in its broadest sense, implying an impersonality at the basis of the self. Moi is a more restricted concept: the “me” as subject of enunciation for the “I” (je) as subject of the statement.

- **STATEMENT:** Enonce (often “utterance”) has been translated here as “statement,” in keeping with the choice of the English translators of Foucault, to whose conception Deleuze and Guattari’s is closest. “Enunciation” is used for enonciation.

- **TRAIT:** The word trait has a range of meanings not covered by any single word in English. Literally, it refers to a graphic drawing, and to the act of drawing a line. Abstractly, it is the purely graphic element. Figuratively, it is an identifying mark (a feature, or trait in the English sense), or any act constituting a mark or sign. Here, “trait” has been retained in all but narrowly linguistic contexts.
