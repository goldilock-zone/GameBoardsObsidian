# Section 1: Identifying Workshop Categories

In this section, Ishita and Ankita embark on a conversation centered around the concept of identifying workshop categories for their project. They contemplate the process of character identification within games and the timeline for crafting calls for participation. The duo envisions how these calls can shape communities and foster entangled mediated fandom.

Ishita begins by proposing the idea of identifying characters within games as a fundamental aspect of their project. She suggests that by conducting multiple passes, they can pinpoint characters both before and after their workshop, which would allow them to refine their workshop calls over time. She posits that it would be around the third pass, typically by the end of October, when they would draft the call for participation in the workshops.

Ankita adds to the discussion by emphasizing that the call for workshops could encompass various categories, such as character creation, site building, and crafting subjectivities. These categories begin to emerge organically as they explore the possibilities within their project.

Ishita further expands on this idea by highlighting the importance of crafting specific calls for participation. She mentions an intriguing example where someone has identified a snake in "moksha pattam" as residing in the "chamber of secrets." She suggests crafting calls that resonate with potential participants, like urging heirs to Slytherin to uncover this hidden snake. These narrative calls aim to understand how loops are formed and communities are built based on shared interests and affinities.

Ankita chimes in, appreciating the entangled mediated fandom aspect of this approach. She envisions people from different groups or communities coming together due to shared interests, creating a dynamic and diverse event.

The conversation then transitions towards the idea of building both laws of similarities and laws of differences. Ishita believes that communities can form not only based on similarities but also through embracing differences. She highlights her unique connection with Ankita, who is more different than similar to her, yet their differences contribute to their community-building efforts.

As they navigate through these thoughts, they explore the nuanced dynamics of communities formed through resemblances and affinities. Ishita underlines the importance of these concepts in their project, which aims to bring together a diverse range of participants.

In summary, Section 1 lays the groundwork for their project, with Ishita and Ankita discussing the identification of characters, the development of workshop categories, and the role of calls for participation in fostering communities. This section sets the stage for the subsequent discussions on entanglement, Foucault's concepts, revisiting project goals, and collaboration.

# Section 2: Exploring Entanglement and Foucault's Concepts

In this section of the transcript, Ishita and Ankita delve into the concept of entanglement and its implications for their project. They draw on the ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault to discuss the formation of knowledge, resemblances, and the role of sympathy and antipathy in shaping communities.

Ishita initiates the discussion by emphasizing the significance of entanglement in their project. She notes that entanglement occurs because of laws of similarity and difference. Ankita concurs, pointing out that their event itself is intended to be a site of entanglement, bringing together individuals from diverse groups and communities.

Ishita introduces Foucault's concept of the "episteme," explaining that it represents the prevailing condition of the world at a specific point in time, influencing the type of knowledge that can be produced. She states that the 16th century episteme revolved around the production of knowledge through resemblances. This historical perspective helps frame their project's exploration of entanglement.

Ankita agrees with Ishita's analysis, acknowledging the historical shifts in knowledge production and the increasing distance between signs and their referents. They discuss how, in the 16th century, knowledge was produced through signs that closely resembled the things they signified.

Ishita further elaborates on Foucault's ideas, identifying four ways in which resemblance is built: convenience, emulation, sympathy, and a fourth concept they can't recall at the moment. Convenience involves spatial connections, grouping things together because they coexist in space. Emulation, on the other hand, transcends spatial limitations, emphasizing the adoption of certain words or concepts from others. Ishita uses Ankita's habit of frequently using the word "interesting" as an example of emulation.

As the conversation progresses, Ishita shares Foucault's concept of sympathy, which she describes as a form of resemblance that can subsume other elements. Sympathy, she explains, doesn't require space or time constraints and has a subsuming nature. It can make one believe they understand and can appropriate what others are feeling.

Ankita agrees with Ishita's analysis of sympathy and highlights that it often leads to action, but there is a fine line beyond which it turns into appropriation. They discuss how sympathy is relevant to various real-world situations, especially during times of tragedy, and how it can be both a positive and potentially problematic force.

Ishita goes on to emphasize the role of antipathy as a counterpoint to sympathy. Antipathy allows individuals to acknowledge resemblances but remain apathetic, preserving diversity and preventing a single order from subsuming everything.

The conversation then turns to the contemporary relevance of these concepts, with Ishita suggesting that sympathy is what fuels movements like Black Lives Matter, where people express solidarity and support for those affected by racial injustice.

Ankita acknowledges the complexity of these concepts and their applicability in the real world, especially in the context of their project's goals. She suggests that understanding the forces of sympathy and antipathy could help them better navigate community-building within their project.

As the section concludes, Ishita mentions the need to revisit their original project goals and reflect on whether their recent insights align with their initial intentions. Ankita concurs and suggests that they need to evaluate whether their project has strayed from its original focus on the sensorium and crafting different subjectivities. They also consider how the concept of entanglement fits into their overall project framework and how it might influence their engagement with different communities.

Section 2 provides a deep exploration of entanglement and Foucault's concepts, offering insights into how these ideas can inform their project's direction. The discussion highlights the dynamic nature of their collaboration and their commitment to critically engaging with theoretical concepts to shape their work effectively. This section sets the stage for further reflections and discussions on the evolution of their project and its potential impact.

# Section 3: Community Building and Narrative Calls

In this section of the transcript, Ishita and Ankita delve into the practical aspects of their project, focusing on community building and narrative calls. They discuss the process of identifying characters, crafting workshop categories, and creating calls for participation. This section highlights their intention to use narrative calls to test how communities form and the role of similarities, differences, and affinities in this process.

Ishita begins by proposing the idea of identifying characters within the games they are working with, both before and after their workshop. She suggests that through multiple passes, they can refine their understanding of these characters. She envisions the third pass, around the end of October, as the point where they will write the call for participation in the workshops. This call for participation will encourage participants to engage with the characters they've identified.

Ankita responds positively to the idea, recognizing that the process of character identification can occur gradually and iteratively. She suggests that they could categorize workshops based on the themes emerging from their project, such as character creation, site building, and crafting subjectivities. This leads to the formation of four simple workshop categories.

The conversation then shifts to the creation of narrative calls for participation. Ishita describes these calls as prompts designed to engage participants in a unique way. She provides an example where someone has identified a snake in a game as residing in a "chamber of secrets." The call for participation would then be crafted to appeal to potential participants, such as heirs to Slytherin, by inviting them to interact with the snake in the chamber of secrets. Ishita emphasizes that such narrative calls are meant to explore how communities form and evolve through shared interests and resemblances.

Ankita recognizes the power of these narrative calls in bringing people from different groups and communities together. She refers to their project as an "entangled mediated fandom," highlighting that individuals from various backgrounds can find common ground through these calls and shared interests.

Ishita further explains their intention to create communities through similarities, resemblances, and affinities but with an absurd twist. They aim to engage participants in a playful and imaginative way, pushing the boundaries of what is possible within their project. For example, they might invite participants to join if they want to eat a snake found in an attic.

Ankita appreciates the creative approach and envisions the statistical data they will gather from these prompts. The data will provide insights into how similarities, affinities, and differences are formed among participants. This data-driven approach aligns with their goal of understanding the dynamics of community-building within their project.

The discussion then touches upon the idea of proximity and convenience in resemblance, with Ishita referencing Foucault's work. She explains that convenience groups things together because they coexist spatially. In contrast, emulation involves adopting behaviors or language from others, even without physical proximity. This concept connects with their project's focus on bringing together individuals who share certain resemblances or interests.

Ankita reflects on the concept of proximity, mentioning the possibility of applying Gestalt psychology to understand the relationships formed due to physical closeness. Ishita sees this as an opportunity to explore different forms of entanglement and how their project can contribute to this exploration.

Ishita returns to Foucault's ideas, discussing the concept of sympathy, a form of resemblance that goes beyond identities. Sympathy allows one to understand and express support for another's feelings. It can be subsuming in nature, and its counterpoint is antipathy, where one remains apathetic despite recognizing resemblances.

Ankita connects these concepts to real-world situations, where sympathy can drive individuals to take action, but there's a risk of it turning into appropriation. They discuss the delicate balance between sympathy and antipathy, which is essential for maintaining diversity and preventing the subsumption of one order.

The conversation concludes with Ankita suggesting that they revisit their original project goals in light of their recent discussions. They need to assess whether their project's focus on the sensorium and crafting different subjectivities has evolved or shifted due to their exploration of entanglement and community-building.

Section 3 underscores the practical aspects of Ishita and Ankita's project, demonstrating their commitment to community-building through narrative calls and their engagement with theoretical concepts. Their innovative approach to workshop categories and narrative calls reflects their desire to explore the dynamics of communities formed through shared interests and resemblances. This section sets the stage for further planning and execution of their project, integrating both theoretical and practical elements.

# Section 4: Rethinking Project Goals and Synergies

In this section of the transcript, Ishita and Ankita embark on a journey of self-reflection, contemplating the evolution of their project's goals and how their recent discussions have influenced their approach. They engage in a candid conversation about the project's trajectory and the possible synergies between their ideas.

Ankita initiates this introspective dialogue by suggesting that they revisit their initial project goals. She highlights the need to critically assess whether their project's focus, initially centered on the sensorium and crafting different subjectivities, has shifted due to their recent exploration of entanglement and community-building.

Ishita acknowledges the importance of reassessing their project's direction and articulates her desire to maintain a grounded approach. She emphasizes the significance of starting from where the action is happening, rather than observing from a distance. Ishita's commitment to engaging with the tangible aspects of their project aligns with her intention to reform herself and move away from a distant, guiding perspective.

Ankita concurs with this approach, emphasizing the value of being present in the field and the potential for embodied, performative engagement. She suggests that their project might not be that of mere observers but could involve immersing themselves as active participants. This notion challenges conventional research paradigms and positions them as integral components of the entangled mediated fandom they seek to study.

Ishita delves deeper into the concept of embodiment, considering how their engagement can transcend the role of passive observers. She discusses the possibility of becoming "ghosts or shadows" within the narratives and worlds they are exploring. This transformative idea introduces a performative element, where they actively shape the narratives and experiences they encounter.

Ankita embraces the idea of becoming an active presence within the narratives, embodying the characters and stories they encounter. She underscores the potential for their involvement to extend beyond the traditional ethnographic research framework. This shift challenges their preconceived notions of the project's boundaries and opens up new possibilities for collaboration and co-creation.

Ishita reiterates the importance of co-creation and emphasizes that their engagement should motivate them to reflect continually on their actions and their impact. She underscores the need to document their journey, focusing on the co-creation of futures and the methods that yield specific outcomes.

Ankita emphasizes the iterative nature of their project and the need for ongoing reflection. She acknowledges that their project will evolve organically, driven by their engagement and experiences within the entangled mediated fandoms they encounter. This adaptive approach allows them to remain responsive to the dynamics of the communities they engage with.

Ishita emphasizes the significance of writing and documenting their experiences, drawing parallels to Graham's project. She highlights the potential for collaboration with Graham, exploring opportunities for publication and sharing their findings. This collaborative spirit aligns with their commitment to co-creation and knowledge exchange.

Ankita envisions her own project as an auto-fictional narrative, where the artefact and exigencies shape the authorial capacity to move within the story. She sees the potential for their projects to intersect and create a narrative continuum, where their explorations feed into each other.

Ishita sees this convergence as an opportunity to extend their collaboration beyond their current project. She envisions a long-term partnership with Graham's team, utilizing their shared interest in science fiction futurism as a foundation for future endeavors.

Ankita expresses her enthusiasm for this extended collaboration and sees it as a valuable opportunity for the development of both projects. She recognizes the potential for their work to contribute to the broader discourse on science fiction and futurism.
