Our entry for the Eye-myth digest will take the form of an exposition + narrative type module, repeated multiple times. The exposition will be the space to ask questions of and for Indie-futurisms and its multiple potential forms of making,  while the narrative will be the space to manifest the network of personae making possible these indie-futures. 

The premise for this write-up is founded in our faith on hyphenated beings and processes that are tangible signs of ideas like diversity, inclusion, tolerance and evolution. Hyphenation, as a specific form of mutation, will be explored as a necessary feature for manifesting indie-futures. 

This process of hyphenated beings for indie-futures will be demonstrated by recording and reconfiguring the characters that exist in game-board “Ganj”. This record will create our framework for both under-histories and indie-futures. These hyphenated beings will be made using the character development exercises grounded in narrative-based research. Taking on a tonality similar to Calvino’s Invisible Cities, the hyphenated beings from “Ganj” will be a record of the invisible peoples from mid-1700s Lucknow that had been always there, and have continued to evolve as personae within the entangled metaphysical plane as the game-board. The diegetic space of the game-board of Ganj and its transformation from an object of play, to an artefact of possession has also contributed to how these personae mutated. 

Our entry for the Eye-myth digest will make visible the interlinked ecologies past, present and future that make up these layered personae, exposing them as free-flowing peoples, continuously made, with little to no distinction between the people and the threads that bind them - the threads and their material condition as much a part of the abilities of the personae. 

This exercise will lead to establish hyphenation as one of the primary necessities of indie-futures. 

You need to become hybrid and hyphenated to produce indie-futures. Absolutes don't produce indie-futures. Neither does under-histories document absolutes. Under-histories is made of the archive of hyphenations and hybrid.
