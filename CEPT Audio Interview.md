In this audio interview, Jay introduces the topic of game design and how students have been given materials to create games. He then welcomes the guests, Ishita and Ankita, from LMNO (Living Midnight Narrative Outfit), who will discuss traditional Indian board games.

Ishita and Ankita begin by explaining the origin of the name LMNO, which stems from the concept of "living midnight" in Taoism. They emphasize their interest in creating new worlds and exploring unusual interpretations of the world.

They describe their diverse backgrounds: Ishita's focus on history, art movements, and underrepresented stories, and Ankita's love for narratives, speculative environments, and science fiction. They see LMNO as a machine that takes various inputs to produce unique and insightful results.

The duo discusses their approach to game design and reading alternate narratives. They explain how their positions and states of mind influence the knowledge they produce, highlighting the importance of positionality in interpreting information.

Ishita and Ankita delve into the concept of games as time capsules and futuring machines. They examine the historical and socio-political elements embedded in traditional Indian board games and how they reflect the cultures and societies in which they were created.

They focus on Mankala, an ancient game with roots in East Africa, explaining its significance and cultural connections. They also discuss Pachisi, its various forms, and the gender dynamics surrounding its play.

The duo explores how different versions of Pachisi boards have unique features, materials, and narratives. They emphasize the intricate craftsmanship and symbolic representations found in Pachisi boards.

Next, Ishita and Ankita introduce the game of Ganj, commissioned by a British officer in the 1700s. They explain its narrative elements, archetypal experiences, and unique movement pattern, which combines a spiral and orthogonal grid.

They also highlight the abstract and open-ended landscapes depicted in these game boards, emphasizing the imaginative aspects of gameplay. The discussion touches on the interpretation of spatialities within board games and the role of player visualization.

Ishita and Ankita are discussing the significance of traditional Indian board games in their project titled "Sites of Indie Futurisms." They explore the historical and cultural aspects of these games, emphasizing their role as more than just artifacts but also as sites of production, participation, and socialization.

The conversation continues with Ishita highlighting the influence of lived experiences and exposure on imagination, as seen in the game board commissioned by Richard Johnson, featuring Kashmiri immigrant artists' interpretations of landscapes. They ponder how someone with limited exposure, like someone imprisoned in a room for two years, would imagine and represent a garden, for example.

They touch on the evolution of traditional Indian games like Ganjifa cards and Goose, showcasing the complexity and variety of chess boards, including the significance of character design and agency of chessmen.

The discussion then shifts to the broader context of these games and their impact on players. They explore how game boards can serve didactic purposes, teaching players about virtues and vices. They also delve into the historical and philosophical elements embedded in these games, such as the Jain beliefs reflected in game boards.

Ishita and Ankita highlight the importance of understanding the systemic forces at play in the creation and interpretation of these game boards. They emphasize how the language and iconography used in these boards can reflect societal hierarchies and worldviews.

They introduce their project, "Sites of Indie Futurisms," which explores the multifaceted nature of game boards as sites of production, participation, pleasure, risk, intellectual engagement, and socialization. They raise the question of how changing the agency of characters on game boards can influence the individuals who interact with them, including players, makers, and researchers.

The discussion then turns to the concept of "Indie Futurisms," which challenges conventional views of history and future thinking. They argue for a rhizomatic, networked approach to thinking that allows for multiple possibilities and scenarios rather than binary outcomes.

Finally, Ishita and Ankita encourage a shift in perspective by proposing imaginative scenarios where players can influence the narrative of the game, even if it involves unconventional actions like slicing open a snake in a snakes and ladders game. This perspective aligns with their concept of "Under Histories," which embraces a diverse and nuanced understanding of history and its impact on future thinking.

Ankita and Ishita's presentation revolves around the concept of "Indie Futurisms," which challenges traditional notions of history, future, and design. They begin by highlighting how the conventional understanding of history and future is often binary and linear, focusing on a narrow set of events and perspectives. They argue that there are under histories and alternative futures that are often overlooked because of our conditioned thinking.

The presentation discusses the importance of considering different perspectives when studying history and design. It emphasizes the need to look beyond the obvious details of a building or an object and explore the broader context, including where materials come from and how they impact various communities. The example of dams in India is cited to illustrate how different communities have vastly different experiences and views of the same event, which challenges the mainstream historical narrative.

The speakers introduce the idea of "futures" and explore how it is conventionally understood. They discuss various categories of futures, such as plausible, probable, preferable, and assumed, and how these projections are made from the present. They emphasize the need to also consider the present and its complexities when thinking about the future.

The presentation delves into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as an example of an intricate world-building exercise. It illustrates how different characters, stories, and realms within the MCU interact and entangle, creating a rich narrative tapestry. The concept of layers within the MCU is introduced, highlighting how different characters and stories inhabit the same world but exist in different layers.

Ankita and Ishita connect the idea of world-building in the MCU to board games, suggesting that similar complex interactions can be explored within the context of game boards. They encourage students to think about the relationships between different elements in board games, such as ladders and snakes, and how these interactions can be diagrammed and modified.

The presentation also introduces alternative forms of futuring, including speculative design, critical design, and discursive design. It emphasizes the importance of generating conversations and discourse rather than simply solving problems. The speakers highlight scholars like Donna Harraway, Ursula Le Guin, and Arturo Escobar, who offer alternative perspectives on futuring and world-building.

The concept of "fictioning" is introduced as an exercise in engaging with design as a form of storytelling and world-building. Fictioning allows for the exploration of different narratives, histories, and futures, challenging conventional thinking and encouraging designers to consider multiple perspectives.

In summary, Ankita and Ishita's presentation encourages students to question traditional notions of history, future, and design, and to explore alternative perspectives and narratives. They emphasize the importance of considering the present, engaging in world-building, and generating discourse as essential components of a holistic design practice.
