Strata, stratification

The strata are phenomena of thickening on the Body of the
earth, simultaneously molecular and molar: accumulations,
coagulations, sedimentations, foldings. They are Belts, Pincers,
or Articulations. Summarily and traditionally, we distinguish
three major strata: physicochemical, organic, and
anthropomorphic (or “alloplastic’). Each stratum, or
articulation, consists of coded milieus and formed substances.
Forms and substances, codes and milieus are not really distinct. They
are the abstract components of every articulation.

A stratum obviously presents very diverse forms and
substances, a variety of codes and milieus. It thus possesses
both different formal Types of organization and different
substantial Modes of development, which divide it into
parastrata and epistrata, for example, the divisions of the organic
stratum. The epistrata and parastrata subdividing a stratum can
be considered strata themselves (so that the list is never
exhaustive). A given stratum retains a unity of composition in
spite of the diversity in its organization and development. The
unity of composition relates to formal traits common to all of
the forms or codes of a stratum, and to substantial elements,
materials common to all of the stratum’s substances or milieus.
The strata are extremely mobile. One stratum is always capable
of serving as the substratum of another, or of colliding with
another, independently of any evolutionary order. Above all,
between two strata or between two stratic divisions, there are
