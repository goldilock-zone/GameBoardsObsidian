# **Section 1: Auto-Fiction as a Methodology for Understanding Indie Futures**

In a candid and reflective dialogue, Ankita initiates a conversation that delves into the intriguing concept of auto-fiction as a methodology for understanding the present and its implications for shaping indie futures. The discourse takes an enthralling journey through the realms of narrative, personal experiences, historical context, and collective action.

Ankita sets the tone by highlighting the ongoing discourse about indie futures. She postulates that these futures are not distant or abstract but rather integral parts of the indie present, akin to sparks that exist in the present moment. As she articulates her perspective, the discussion gains momentum, exploring how indie futures are not mere abstractions but stories that are continually being crafted and reimagined.

The conversation weaves seamlessly as Ankita suggests the idea of transforming their current session into a story. It's a story about three individuals who gather to examine different games, identify a knot within their network, and subsequently branch out into various directions. This narrative approach offers a fresh perspective on how sessions like these can be utilized as tools to map content, narratives, and scenarios. These scenarios, as Ankita points out, are intrinsically linked to what they've collectively identified throughout the week.

What unfolds is a recognition that personal narratives are intertwined with larger societal narratives. Ankita alludes to her own exploration of a snakes and ladders story from her past, suggesting that it has contributed to shaping her identity. This introspective journey into one's past experiences and stories as a way of understanding the present is a theme that resonates throughout the discussion.

Ishita joins the conversation, introducing a fascinating historical context. She draws parallels to the Dadaist movement in Berlin during the post-World War I era. Ishita underscores the importance of being present in the moment, a stark contrast to the prevalent trend of planning for the future, even in the aftermath of such a significant global event. She argues that making choices and being engaged in the present is an act of agency and influence, as opposed to escaping the present, which relinquishes one's power to make meaningful choices.

Ankita masterfully connects this idea back to the broader conversation about citizenship. She emphasizes that citizenship isn't solely about rectifying past mistakes or preparing for multiple futures. Instead, it's intricately tied to the choices made in the present. The discussion meanders through various topics, including climate change, the indie culture, and societal attitudes towards the future.

Divyaraj contributes a unique perspective, contemplating the idea of turning games like snakes and ladders into tools for understanding and addressing critical issues such as climate change. He touches upon the concept of collaboration and partnership, drawing inspiration from these games to ponder how individuals can form connections with the more-than-human world. This idea is beautifully linked to the dynamics of partnerships in superhero narratives, where different combinations of characters yield diverse outcomes.

As the dialogue progresses, Ishita reflects on the lack of choice in certain chance-based games like Gunj. She observes that these games mirror life itself, where you can't refuse to move forward even if it leads to difficult situations. The analogy is drawn to the unwavering dedication of healthcare workers during the pandemic, highlighting their commitment to serving others, even when faced with perilous circumstances.

The conversation takes an unexpected turn as Divyaraj proposes a creative and holistic approach. He envisions merging games like snakes and ladders, chaupar, and Gunj into a single, transformative experience. These games, with their distinct characteristics and narratives, could be interconnected in a way that leads players through various emotional and intellectual challenges. This fusion of games is seen as a means to foster different types of citizenship, each with its unique set of skills, values, and perspectives.

Ishita poses a thought-provoking question about the significance of sequence in this interconnected game. Does the order in which players navigate these games impact their learning and development as citizens? This query raises considerations about the experiential journey and its potential influence on the players' understanding of the world around them.

Ankita shares insights from popular culture, drawing parallels between this interconnected game and the iconic Kung Fu Panda movie, where a seemingly empty scroll holds profound wisdom. This analogy underscores the idea that sometimes, the journey itself is more valuable than the destination.

The discussion gradually shifts towards a reflection on colonial history. Ishita expresses her desire to approach the colonial past from a non-post-colonial lens. She aims to explore the complexities of colonialism without adopting the role of victim or casting judgment. The conversation touches on the legacy of colonialism and how it has influenced different aspects of society and culture.

In this captivating introduction to the dialogue, Ankita, Ishita, and Divyaraj lay the groundwork for a profound exploration of auto-fiction as a methodology. They navigate through diverse themes, from personal narratives to colonial legacies, while drawing inspiration from games, historical movements, and popular culture. The stage is set for a multifaceted and enlightening discourse on the intricate interplay between the past, present, and future in the context of indie futures.

# **Section 2: Diving Deeper into Dadaism and Presentism**

In this section, Ishita takes the reins of the conversation, expanding upon the intriguing concepts of Dadaism and presentism introduced earlier. She delves into the historical context of Dadaism and its relevance in the aftermath of World War I. Ishita also unpacks the idea of presentism, emphasizing the importance of making choices and the implications of escaping the present.

Ishita begins by shedding light on the Dadaist movement during its Berlin phase, which unfolded around 1922 in the wake of the First World War. She paints a vivid picture of the post-war era when many were eager to forget the war and plan for the future. However, the Dadaists took a different stance; they championed the act of being present and making choices. This was a moment when society was preoccupied with envisioning what lay ahead, and the Dadaists advocated for embracing the present moment and the decisions it demanded.

The discussion revolves around the Dadaists' unique perspective on the concept of being present. Ishita references an essay titled "Dada Presentism" or something similar, which she suggests as a valuable resource. The Dadaists argued that being in the present meant actively making choices that had a direct impact on one's life and, consequently, the lives of others. Their viewpoint challenged the prevailing tendency to escape the present, which often led to a lack of agency and influence over one's circumstances.

Ankita skillfully connects this discourse to the broader theme of citizenship. She observes that citizenship extends beyond a mere focus on rectifying past mistakes or preparing for an uncertain future. Instead, it encompasses the choices individuals make in the present, choices that ripple through society, and choices that define the character of communities and collectives. The discussion highlights the relevance of these ideas in addressing contemporary challenges like climate change and the indie culture's pursuit of a better future.

Divyaraj contributes to the conversation by drawing parallels between the Dadaist movement's emphasis on making choices in the present and the choices made by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. He highlights the moral duty and sense of responsibility that compelled doctors to serve others, even at great personal risk. The analogy underscores the notion that making choices in the present is not only an act of personal agency but also a means of influencing and shaping the lives of others.

The dialogue takes an unexpected but poignant turn as Ishita reflects on the legacy of colonialism. She expresses her intention to approach this historical narrative from a non-post-colonial perspective, eschewing the roles of victimhood or judgment. This shift in perspective prompts the participants to reconsider the ways in which colonialism has left lasting imprints on cultures, societies, and individuals.

As the conversation unfolds, Ankita introduces insights from her recent viewing of "Downton Abbey," a historical drama series set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She highlights how the show portrays English attitudes toward India during the colonial era. This illustration of how India and other colonial subjects were discussed in British society offers a nuanced perspective on colonial history.

The dialogue also touches on the nuances of post-colonial theory and its limitations. The participants express a desire to explore history through multiple lenses, aiming to better understand the intricacies of colonialism without resorting to judgmental narratives.

In this section, Ishita leads a captivating discussion that fleshes out the concepts of Dadaism and presentism. The conversation underscores the importance of making choices in the present, a theme interwoven with the notion of citizenship and its role in shaping indie futures. The participants draw inspiration from historical movements and popular culture, all while embracing a non-post-colonial lens to analyze colonial legacies, setting the stage for a rich and multifaceted exploration of these complex topics.

# **Section 3: The Intersection of Indie Futures and Traditional Games**

Divyaraj presents an intriguing idea to combine three traditional Indian board games: Snakes and Ladders, Chaupar, and Gunj. He envisions a unique narrative journey that traverses these games, offering participants a transformative experience while highlighting the development of different types of citizenship.

Divyaraj's proposal sparks a vibrant discussion among the participants. He suggests starting with Snakes and Ladders and then transitioning to Chaupar at a crossroads. In this junction, players must decide whether to take a strategic path or another route. Depending on their choice, they could either proceed to a game of Chess or embark on the challenging journey of Gunj. This imaginative sequence of games aims to impart valuable life lessons and foster diverse forms of citizenship.

Ankita, Ishita, and Divyaraj emphasize the significance of this narrative journey, reflecting on the emotional and moral aspects it could encompass. They contemplate the impact of each game on players, ranging from learning to overcome biases to discovering the value of collaboration and coexistence. The conversation weaves a narrative that connects these games into a holistic experience that embodies the essence of indie futures.

The participants also consider the ambiguity surrounding the concept of "treasure" within the Gunj game. They discuss how this ambiguity could be harnessed to encourage players to define their own treasures, whether they be connections with the more-than-human world, concepts of wealth, or other personal values. This open-ended interpretation enhances the depth and richness of the proposed narrative journey.

Incorporating elements from traditional board games into the exploration of indie futures showcases the potential for new and transformative experiences. Divyaraj's vision of this interconnected game sequence resonates with the participants, opening up possibilities for creative and immersive learning experiences that encourage self-discovery, collaboration, and thoughtful decision-making.

Divyaraj's idea centers around the idea of using these traditional games as a framework to explore the development of different types of citizenship. He envisions a sequence where players begin with Snakes and Ladders, a game of chance that symbolizes the ups and downs of life. At a crucial crossroads, they are faced with a choice between two paths: one leading to Chaupar, a strategic game, and the other to Gunj, a challenging and transformative experience.

The proposed sequence is more than just a series of games; it represents a journey of self-discovery and growth. The participants discuss how each game in the sequence can teach valuable life lessons. Snakes and Ladders, with its random twists of fate, mirrors the unpredictability of life's journey. Chaupar, a game of strategy and collaboration, highlights the importance of working together and making informed decisions.

The conversation also touches upon the significance of ambiguity in Gunj. By leaving the concept of "treasure" open to interpretation, players are encouraged to reflect on their own definitions of wealth and success. This ambiguity adds depth to the narrative journey, allowing participants to explore their personal beliefs and values.

The fusion of traditional games with the concept of indie futures is met with enthusiasm. The participants recognize the potential for this unique narrative journey to serve as an educational tool that promotes self-awareness, collaboration, and critical thinking. It offers an alternative approach to learning and personal development, one that is rooted in cultural heritage and open to creative interpretation.
