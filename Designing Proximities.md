Ashwatta Kattes ( Peepal Tree shrines)- People tree shrines in Bangalore have an intricate web of unspoken understanding between space and community engagement. While the sacred stones resting under the tree’s shade on an elevated platform demands worship from the localities, it also shapeshifts as a bustling interaction hub in the evenings. From everyday gossip to life-changing conversations, the kattes are the crown jewels and one decides to document it through time and space, interesting proximities can be plotted.

Bangalore, despite racing with modern times, still managed to keep these Ashwata Katte traditions alive to some extent. While some falling within the vicinity of temples is breathing safe, most of them are constantly fighting for survival. Professor Kiran Keswani, who has been researching the kattes of Bangalore for two decades, points out that kattes are an important “Social design element” of urban planning. ‘Ashwath Katte is a sustainable urban space’ – how through the practice of tree worship, people both generate and sustain these community spaces and how they work as religious and social spaces.
