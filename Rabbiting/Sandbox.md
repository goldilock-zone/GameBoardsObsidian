Workflow for building narratives around interactive interactive spaces: 
The observer of the space must force the format of a search for subjectivities that exist within the space. These subjectivities could emerge out of the interaction of several subspaces within the space, that allow the observation of the interval subspaces (spaces in between the subspaces). Holding onto that extracted information, it may be flattened into another structure that allows interpretable logic to be destroyed, and newly transfigured at the same time. 
Introducing "peers" of the observer now would be useful to merge, and interpret the flat information, in order to cause the formation of a new body of subjectivities. In a tree of information(word)-interpreter(reader) relationships, this would constitute a single level of depth, or height, the boundary between the two being akin to the boundary between the interiority and exteriority of a monad.   
The emergodestructed subjectivities would assume contexts, set up by similar processes, "bubbling" out of an information field that forms the background to the surface on which exists the Tree of information(word)-interpreter(reader) relationships. 
An iteration of this process would form a continuum, which, forzen would allow us a snapshot of information density, that would constitute a narrative (subjectivity) generating process.
