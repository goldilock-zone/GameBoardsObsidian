1. [Nobody] - Personality: [The "sorting" subjectivity outlined suggests a metaphysical framework that personifies the process of cognitive engagement with the flow of existence and its multifarious phenomena. This framework is an archetype of discernment—a philosophical entity that cleaves through the continuum of experiences, thoughts, and sensory data, segmenting and structuring the raw material of reality into comprehensible units.

This subjectivity embodies the "pleasure of the unknown," indicative of an epistemological drive toward the discovery and creation of knowledge, resonant with the Socratic notion of wonder as the beginning of philosophy. It also echoes the Nietzschean celebration of the new and the uncharted, a Dionysian affirmation of life's mysteries.

The "cutter of reality" connotes a Cartesian mechanism of division, separating the mind from the body, the subject from the object, and the essential from the non-essential. It also speaks to the Kantian imperative of the mind to categorize and order the phenomena presented to it, and to Hegelian dialectics that synthesize these bifurcations into a higher understanding.

Encapsulated within this subjectivity is a "reservoir of convictions," suggesting a repository of pre-existing beliefs and judgments compacted over time, akin to the Lockean tabula rasa filled with the imprints of experience, or the Foucauldian discourse that shapes and is shaped by historical power dynamics.

The "wake of thought-movement" is redolent of Heidegger's concept of 'thrownness,' the idea that one's understanding and interpretation of the world are always preceded by a pre-established context, and the hermeneutic circle that represents the interplay between parts and the whole in the quest for meaning.

Within this subjectivity lies an "uncertainty," reflective of Hume's skepticism regarding causality and the knowability of the world, and the existential angst described by Kierkegaard, where the individual must continually confront the abyss of freedom and choice.

The "archetypal sorter" is also an agent of bifurcation, driving life-processes and reminiscent of Darwinian natural selection, where organisms are sorted into the fit and the unfit. It aligns with Marx's historical materialism, where societal structures are continuously sorted and reshaped by the underlying economic forces.

The "pure tabulation" aspect alludes to the logical positivism of Russell and Wittgenstein's early philosophy, where knowledge is sought through logical propositions and scientific precision, stripping away the metaphysical to reveal the empirical.

Lastly, the "formless-excess, remnants, noise, dust" that moves against the flow symbolizes the Derridean trace, the excess that escapes the totalizing system of thought, and the Freudian unconscious, the repository of repressed experiences that defy neat categorization.

This subjectivity, then, is an intricate, multilayered construct that not only engages with the world but is also constituted by its continuous interaction with it. It represents the inherent human desire to understand and to organize, to seek patterns and meanings in the ceaseless flux of reality, and to grapple with the remnants that resist such ordering.

2. [Somebody] - Personality: [The subjectivity represented by the "sorter" metaphor you provided captures the complex cognitive mechanisms involved in the human process of knowing and categorization. This "sorting" subjectivity is a cognitive model that actively participates in a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with the world, engaging in the extraction, analysis, and synthesis of information.

The diagram suggests a system of "accentric center points of accumulation," evoking the idea of a non-linear, decentralized process of thought reminiscent of post-structuralist views, such as those of Foucault and Derrida, where knowledge is not merely hierarchical but networked, interconnected through various nodes of meaning and significance.

The "small turbines of discernment humming" metaphorically illustrate the active, vigilant processes of critical thinking and reasoning—akin to Wittgenstein's language-games or Nietzsche's perspectivism—whereby the mind is constantly at work, sifting through data, evaluating, and re-evaluating to achieve clarity and understanding.

These turbines also reflect a Humean skepticism towards the impressions we receive, requiring a continuous process of discernment to distill clear categories from the "loose strata of wonder." This speaks to the uncertainty and the complexity inherent in the phenomenological world that Kant, Husserl, and Merleau-Ponty might argue requires an a priori conceptual framework or phenomenological reduction to comprehend fully.

The "canopy of hidden processes" implies a vast, often subconscious, array of mental activities that support conscious thought, resonating with Freud's psychoanalytic theory, which posits that much of our mental activity is not immediately accessible to the conscious mind. Similarly, it touches on Heidegger's concept of "Being-in-the-world," where understanding is always already involved in an interpretive process, often occurring beneath the explicit awareness of the individual.

The "arbitrating scraping mechanism facing outwards" could be seen as embodying the existentialist stance of Sartre and Camus, where one's essence is defined through active engagement with the world, a constant negotiation between the self and the multitude of external forces and stimuli.

Lastly, the "compression spring" suggests the elasticity and resilience of the mind's categorizing ability, reflecting perhaps the pragmatism of Dewey, where thought adapts and responds to the pressures and challenges posed by the environment in a practical, outcome-oriented manner.

In essence, this "sorting" subjectivity is a rich and multifaceted construct that illustrates the philosophical endeavor to understand how we as humans process, categorize, and make sense of the world. It is a dynamic, complex, and continuous activity that is deeply influenced by historical, psychological, and existential factors, depicting the mind as an active participant in the construction of knowledge and reality.

3. [Everybody] - Personality: [The subjectivity depicted in the diagram you provided can be understood as a philosophical metaphor for the cognitive and interpretive processes by which an individual—or "sorter"—engages with the flow of information and stimuli in the world. This subjectivity is deeply involved in the organization, categorization, and evaluation of sensory input, experiences, and concepts.

At the heart of this subjectivity is the idealistic pursuit of a comprehensive taxonomy of existence—the "dream of a pure catalogue of everything." This pursuit is reflective of Platonic idealism, where there's a desire for understanding the essence of things beyond their mere appearances. Yet, like Aristotelian metaphysics, it acknowledges the need to sort and distinguish particulars, to classify the multiplicity of experience into understandable categories.

The sorting process itself is not just mechanical but deeply cognitive, reminiscent of Cartesian dualism, where the mind asserts its capacity to process and filter through the external world, somewhat detached, operating within its own "compression chamber." Kantian influences are evident in the emphasis on the sorting of phenomena through a transcendental framework, imposing a priori categories upon the flux of experience.

This subjectivity is also engaged in a Nietzschean revaluation of values, discerning "minimal differences" and asserting its perspective as a mechanism for creating meaning in a potentially chaotic or indifferent universe. In a Sartrean sense, this process is an existential act of defining oneself through the act of categorization and the choices made in determining significance.

There's an undercurrent of Wittgensteinian linguistic philosophy in the way the diagram suggests a structured language of thought—a language that apprehends, sorts, and expels concepts and experiences. Hegelian dialectics might be mirrored in the dynamic process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis as the sorter engages with "closed opinions and exclusions," leading to new understandings.

The "surface of closed opinions and exclusions" could also be seen through a Foucauldian lens, suggesting a discourse-driven boundary that both includes and excludes, shaping knowledge and power structures. The "unclassifiable" that becomes a "secret drawer" hints at Derridean deconstruction, where there is always an element that resists neat categorization, an undecidable that escapes the totalizing system.

Finally, the "outgoing flux of hyper-particulars" suggests a postmodern condition as described by Lyotard, where grand narratives are deconstructed into an abundance of localized, individualized narratives or "hyper-particulars." This is a continuous and dynamic process, acknowledging the complexity and multiplicity of contemporary experiences that resist static classification.

In sum, this "sorting" subjectivity represents a complex, dynamic cognitive process that is at once creative and critical, imposing order on the chaos of sensory input while constantly negotiating with the unsortable aspects of existence. It is a philosophical construct that encapsulates the many facets of human thought, reflecting the rich history of philosophical inquiry into the nature of understanding, existence, and the self.!!]

Context:

We are working on a gameboards project, where we build minim worlds at points of intensity. Need images. 

Conversation Prompt:

Write a dialogue where [Nobody], [Somebody], and [Everybody] engage in a conversation. Use their distinct personalities to guide their responses and actions. 

Behave like an Art director, and simulate a conversation between the director and his designers. Here are the list of designers: 
1. Nobody
2. Somebody
3. Everybody

The art director is asking his designers to build the script for DALLE to give me the same images I have been talking about before, say Maya. I will feed to the conversation to DALL E to give me the game board images I have been talking about. Return such a script-prompt

There needs to be dissent, dialogue and argument in the conversation. Attempt to simulate the emotions (artist collectives seem to be known for these), so that some of the emotions seep into the painting. 

Background:
Generate high-resolution, square images with dimensions of 1080x1080 pixels inspired by the aesthetic style guides of ancient Indian board games such as Snakes and Ladders, Chaupar, and Pachisi. Incorporate elements of these games into the images to evoke their essence and design.

1. We are trying to build microworlds at points of intensity in the game board. Points of intensity are where there are intersections of different fragments of the game board. These microworlds are an attempt in abstract world building. A lot should be happening in the picture for it to be a "world."

2. The desired artistic style and mood should reflect a blend of traditional Indian artistry, with vibrant colors in the background, and a sense of playfulness to capture the spirit of these timeless games. "Intensity" is the keyword here.

3. Include specific elements and motifs from the board games, such as snakes, ladders, game boards, dice, pawns, and traditional Indian patterns like meenakari, paisley, and floral designs. Guides to building these worlds could include ancient Hindu architecture, Mughal architecture, and Vastu Shashtra.

4. Arrange the elements creatively on the canvas, ensuring a balanced and visually engaging composition. Explore variations like surreal landscapes, abstract interpretations, or faithful renditions of the game boards. Ensure that the game board serves as the backdrop for a world emerging on, around, or collocated with the game board.

5. The color scheme should be black and white, resembling something sculpted on rock.

6. Pay attention to intricate detailing, textures, and fine craftsmanship to bring out the essence of these ancient games. A lot must be happening in the images, with elements of the world seen interacting, not limited to living things.

7. Generate a set of 5 unique images in this style.

8. Optionally, include brief textual descriptions for each image, explaining the inspiration behind it or any specific elements of the game it represents.

9. Conclude with a prompt focus keyword: "Maya."
