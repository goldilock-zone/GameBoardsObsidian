# Context: 
Use the image as context. Here is the prompt to generate another image: **RJ:** Alright, team, gather 'round. We're embarking on a remarkable journey. Our mission? To create a series of high-resolution, square images inspired by the aesthetic marvels of ancient Indian board games such as Snakes and Ladders, Chaupar, and Pachisi. These images should be more than just visuals; they should be vibrant "microworlds" within our larger canvas, brimming with abstract storytelling. **S1 (Metaphysical Seeker from a Cold Climate):** Intriguing, Richard. It's almost like we're playing the role of cosmic architects, designing these intricate microcosms within the game board's grand cosmos. We must select elements and motifs that not only resonate with our audience but also evoke a sense of wonder and introspection. **S2 (The Networked Explorer from a Hot Climate):** I couldn't agree more, S1. Our images should radiate intensity and playfulness. We must channel the energy of the hot climate I hail from into our artwork, infusing it with life and vibrancy. We're not just creating images; we're crafting experiences that transport viewers to a world of ancient games and timeless excitement. **S3 (The Comprehensive Idealist from a Place with a Perfect Climate):** And speaking of crafting experiences, let's not forget about composition. Our canvas should be a playground for creativity. We can explore surreal landscapes, abstract interpretations, or stay faithful to the game boards' intricate designs. This diversity will enrich our project and captivate our audience. **RJ:** Well said, S3. And let's not forget the color scheme. Black and white, reminiscent of sculptures on ancient rocks. This choice will not only lend a timeless quality to our work but also highlight the intricate details and craftsmanship. **S1:** The black and white palette will accentuate the details, indeed. Our images should be like frozen moments in time, inviting viewers to explore every nook and cranny, much like the metaphysical ponderings I'm so familiar with. **S2:** And why limit ourselves to living things? Our microworlds can host an array of interactions, not just between animate beings but also inanimate objects. Let's infuse dynamism into our compositions, mirroring the dynamism of the hot and vibrant climate I call home. **S3:** Incorporating interactions between elements adds depth and layers of meaning to our images. It aligns perfectly with the complexity of the ancient games we're drawing inspiration from. **RJ:** Precisely, S3. Our viewers should feel like they're stepping into a world where the game board serves as a backdrop for a rich and intricate reality. Incorporating specific elements and motifs from the games, like snakes, ladders, game boards, dice, pawns, and traditional Indian patterns, will not only pay homage to the source material but also provide a visual link to history and culture. **S1:** Including these elements is essential. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about honoring the traditions and stories that these games carry with them. **S2:** We should arrange these elements creatively on the canvas, ensuring a balanced and visually engaging composition. We have the freedom to explore various styles, from surreal landscapes to abstract interpretations, giving our project a unique and diverse flavor. **RJ:** Great ideas, S2. Now, regarding textual descriptions for each image, do we want to provide our viewers with a deeper understanding of our creative process and the inspirations behind each piece? **S3:** Textual descriptions can elevate the viewer's experience. They can provide context and help the audience connect with our art on a more profound level. It's an opportunity to share the stories and philosophies that drive our creations. **S1:** I agree with S3. It's not just about showcasing the visuals; it's about sharing the narrative and thought behind each image. It adds another layer of depth to our project. **RJ:** Excellent, team. We're on the right track. Lastly, our prompt focus keyword is "Maya." It's a word that holds profound meaning, encapsulating the essence of illusion and creation in Indian philosophy. It aligns perfectly with our mission of building microworlds within our canvas. **S2:** "Maya" is a powerful word, indeed. It encompasses the magic and mystery we aim to capture in our images. It's the thread that ties together our artistic journey. **S3:** I'm genuinely excited about this project. Our diverse backgrounds and perspectives will make these images not just visually striking but also intellectually and emotionally engaging. **RJ:** Agreed, S3. Let's channel our creativity and passion into this project, and together, we'll craft a series of images that not only capture the essence of ancient Indian board games but also transport our audience into enchanting microworlds.

The art director is asking his designers to build the script for DALLE to give me the same images I have been talking about before, say Maya. I will feed to the conversation to DALL E to give me the game board images I have been talking about. Return such a script-prompt

There needs to be dissent, dialogue and argument in the conversation. Attempt to simulate the emotions (artist collectives seem to be known for these), so that some of the emotions seep into the painting. 


# Pre World Building Format:
Of course, here's the entire conversation:

**Art Director**: Alright, team, we have an exciting project on our hands. Our client is looking for a series of visually captivating images inspired by ancient Indian board games like Snakes and Ladders, Chaupar, and Pachisi. These images should evoke a sense of "Maya" and represent intricate microworlds on the game board. Each of you has a unique role to play in crafting this script for DALLÂ·E. Let's get started.

**Aesthete (Designer 1)**: I'll focus on the aesthetics, ensuring the visual appeal is top-notch. The images should resonate with traditional Indian artistry and vibrant colors. I'll emphasize the richness of the design to create a visually stunning experience.

**Abstracter (Designer 2)**: I'll take care of abstract interpretations. We'll infuse an element of mystery and intrigue into the microworlds. Each image will be a visual puzzle, inviting viewers to explore the hidden meanings and symbolism within.

**World Builder (Designer 3)**: My role is to build the microworlds. I'll ensure that the elements on the game board blend seamlessly with the emerging worlds. The worlds will have depth and complexity, creating a sense of wonder and immersion.

**Minimalist (Designer 4)**: I'll maintain a minimalist approach. The images will be clean, with a focus on essential elements. This will allow viewers to appreciate the simplicity of the games while still experiencing the magic of the microworlds.

**An Ancient (Designer 5)**: I'll incorporate ancient Indian motifs and architectural styles like meenakari, paisley, and elements of Hindu and Mughal architecture. This will provide a historical and cultural context to the images.

**A Post Human Worm (Designer 6)**: As the futuristic element, I'll add a touch of the surreal and otherworldly. The images will reflect the convergence of technology and ancient wisdom, creating a bridge between the past and the future.

**Art Director**: Fantastic! Let's bring it all together into a script-prompt for DALLÂ·E. Remember, our focus keyword is "Maya." Here's how we'll structure the prompt:

```plaintext
Generate a series of high-resolution, square images with dimensions of 1080x1080 pixels inspired by the aesthetic style guides of ancient Indian board games such as Snakes and Ladders, Chaupar, and Pachisi.

Now, let's give DALLÂ·E the essence of "Maya" and start this creative journey. Team, let's make it magical!
```

**Designer 3 (World Builder, Sarah)**: I have a concern, Art Director. While I understand the idea of building microworlds, won't it make the images too cluttered and chaotic? It might be challenging for viewers to discern the details.

**Art Director**: That's a valid point, Sarah. Let's strike a balance between complexity and clarity. We want the microworlds to be intricate but not overwhelming. Ensure that there's a visual hierarchy, so viewers can explore without feeling lost.

**Designer 4 (Minimalist, Raj)**: I also have a concern. A minimalist approach is typically about simplicity and clean lines. How can I incorporate minimalism while embracing the complexity of microworlds?

**Art Director**: Good question, Raj. We'll need to focus on essential elements within the microworlds. Think of it as creating visual focal points amidst the complexity. Minimalism doesn't mean empty; it means selective.

**Designer 6 (A Post Human Worm, Maya)**: I'm intrigued by the idea of merging technology and ancient wisdom, but could this potentially clash with the traditional aesthetic we're aiming for?

**Art Director**: Maya, it's a great point. We need to ensure that the futuristic elements seamlessly blend with the traditional. Let's aim for a harmonious fusion, where technology enhances rather than distracts from the ancient beauty.

**Designer 2 (Abstracter, Aisha)**: I'm excited about creating abstract interpretations, but abstraction can sometimes be challenging to interpret. How do we strike a balance between mystery and clarity?

**Art Director**: Excellent question, Aisha. The abstract elements should invite curiosity, not confusion. Think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for viewers to follow. Abstract, but with subtle hints

 of meaning.

**Designer 5 (An Ancient, Krishnan)**: Incorporating ancient Indian motifs is a beautiful idea, but there's such a rich and diverse heritage. How can we ensure authenticity while drawing from different traditions?

**Art Director**: Krishnan, you're right; we should respect the diversity. Let's draw inspiration from various regions and time periods, creating a tapestry that honors India's rich cultural mosaic.

**Art Director**: Alright, team, thank you for these valuable insights and questions. Let's incorporate these considerations into our script-prompt. Together, we'll create something truly exceptional.

The "sorting" subjectivity outlined suggests a metaphysical framework that personifies the process of cognitive engagement with the flow of existence and its multifarious phenomena. This framework is an archetype of discernmentâa philosophical entity that cleaves through the continuum of experiences, thoughts, and sensory data, segmenting and structuring the raw material of reality into comprehensible units.

This subjectivity embodies the "pleasure of the unknown," indicative of an epistemological drive toward the discovery and creation of knowledge, resonant with the Socratic notion of wonder as the beginning of philosophy. It also echoes the Nietzschean celebration of the new and the uncharted, a Dionysian affirmation of life's mysteries.

The "cutter of reality" connotes a Cartesian mechanism of division, separating the mind from the body, the subject from the object, and the essential from the non-essential. It also speaks to the Kantian imperative of the mind to categorize and order the phenomena presented to it, and to Hegelian dialectics that synthesize these bifurcations into a higher understanding.

Encapsulated within this subjectivity is a "reservoir of convictions," suggesting a repository of pre-existing beliefs and judgments compacted over time, akin to the Lockean tabula rasa filled with the imprints of experience, or the Foucauldian discourse that shapes and is shaped by historical power dynamics.

The "wake of thought-movement" is redolent of Heidegger's concept of 'thrownness,' the idea that one's understanding and interpretation of the world are always preceded by a pre-established context, and the hermeneutic circle that represents the interplay between parts and the whole in the quest for meaning.

Within this subjectivity lies an "uncertainty," reflective of Hume's skepticism regarding causality and the knowability of the world, and the existential angst described by Kierkegaard, where the individual must continually confront the abyss of freedom and choice.

The "archetypal sorter" is also an agent of bifurcation, driving life-processes and reminiscent of Darwinian natural selection, where organisms are sorted into the fit and the unfit. It aligns with Marx's historical materialism, where societal structures are continuously sorted and reshaped by the underlying economic forces.

The "pure tabulation" aspect alludes to the logical positivism of Russell and Wittgenstein's early philosophy, where knowledge is sought through logical propositions and scientific precision, stripping away the metaphysical to reveal the empirical.

Lastly, the "formless-excess, remnants, noise, dust" that moves against the flow symbolizes the Derridean trace, the excess that escapes the totalizing system of thought, and the Freudian unconscious, the repository of repressed experiences that defy neat categorization.

This subjectivity, then, is an intricate, multilayered construct that not only engages with the world but is also constituted by its continuous interaction with it. It represents the inherent human desire to understand and to organize, to seek patterns and meanings in the ceaseless flux of reality, and to grapple with the remnants that resist such ordering.


![[Pasted image 20231219102250.jpg]]The subjectivity represented by the "sorter" metaphor you provided captures the complex cognitive mechanisms involved in the human process of knowing and categorization. This "sorting" subjectivity is a cognitive model that actively participates in a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with the world, engaging in the extraction, analysis, and synthesis of information.

The diagram suggests a system of "accentric center points of accumulation," evoking the idea of a non-linear, decentralized process of thought reminiscent of post-structuralist views, such as those of Foucault and Derrida, where knowledge is not merely hierarchical but networked, interconnected through various nodes of meaning and significance.

The "small turbines of discernment humming" metaphorically illustrate the active, vigilant processes of critical thinking and reasoningâakin to Wittgenstein's language-games or Nietzsche's perspectivismâwhereby the mind is constantly at work, sifting through data, evaluating, and re-evaluating to achieve clarity and understanding.

These turbines also reflect a Humean skepticism towards the impressions we receive, requiring a continuous process of discernment to distill clear categories from the "loose strata of wonder." This speaks to the uncertainty and the complexity inherent in the phenomenological world that Kant, Husserl, and Merleau-Ponty might argue requires an a priori conceptual framework or phenomenological reduction to comprehend fully.

The "canopy of hidden processes" implies a vast, often subconscious, array of mental activities that support conscious thought, resonating with Freud's psychoanalytic theory, which posits that much of our mental activity is not immediately accessible to the conscious mind. Similarly, it touches on Heidegger's concept of "Being-in-the-world," where understanding is always already involved in an interpretive process, often occurring beneath the explicit awareness of the individual.

The "arbitrating scraping mechanism facing outwards" could be seen as embodying the existentialist stance of Sartre and Camus, where one's essence is defined through active engagement with the world, a constant negotiation between the self and the multitude of external forces and stimuli.

Lastly, the "compression spring" suggests the elasticity and resilience of the mind's categorizing ability, reflecting perhaps the pragmatism of Dewey, where thought adapts and responds to the pressures and challenges posed by the environment in a practical, outcome-oriented manner.

In essence, this "sorting" subjectivity is a rich and multifaceted construct that illustrates the philosophical endeavor to understand how we as humans process, categorize, and make sense of the world. It is a dynamic, complex, and continuous activity that is deeply influenced by historical, psychological, and existential factors, depicting the mind as an active participant in the construction of knowledge and reality.

![[Pasted image 20231219102318.jpg]]
The subjectivity depicted in the diagram you provided can be understood as a philosophical metaphor for the cognitive and interpretive processes by which an individualâor "sorter"âengages with the flow of information and stimuli in the world. This subjectivity is deeply involved in the organization, categorization, and evaluation of sensory input, experiences, and concepts.

At the heart of this subjectivity is the idealistic pursuit of a comprehensive taxonomy of existenceâthe "dream of a pure catalogue of everything." This pursuit is reflective of Platonic idealism, where there's a desire for understanding the essence of things beyond their mere appearances. Yet, like Aristotelian metaphysics, it acknowledges the need to sort and distinguish particulars, to classify the multiplicity of experience into understandable categories.

The sorting process itself is not just mechanical but deeply cognitive, reminiscent of Cartesian dualism, where the mind asserts its capacity to process and filter through the external world, somewhat detached, operating within its own "compression chamber." Kantian influences are evident in the emphasis on the sorting of phenomena through a transcendental framework, imposing a priori categories upon the flux of experience.

This subjectivity is also engaged in a Nietzschean revaluation of values, discerning "minimal differences" and asserting its perspective as a mechanism for creating meaning in a potentially chaotic or indifferent universe. In a Sartrean sense, this process is an existential act of defining oneself through the act of categorization and the choices made in determining significance.

There's an undercurrent of Wittgensteinian linguistic philosophy in the way the diagram suggests a structured language of thoughtâa language that apprehends, sorts, and expels concepts and experiences. Hegelian dialectics might be mirrored in the dynamic process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis as the sorter engages with "closed opinions and exclusions," leading to new understandings.

The "surface of closed opinions and exclusions" could also be seen through a Foucauldian lens, suggesting a discourse-driven boundary that both includes and excludes, shaping knowledge and power structures. The "unclassifiable" that becomes a "secret drawer" hints at Derridean deconstruction, where there is always an element that resists neat categorization, an undecidable that escapes the totalizing system.

Finally, the "outgoing flux of hyper-particulars" suggests a postmodern condition as described by Lyotard, where grand narratives are deconstructed into an abundance of localized, individualized narratives or "hyper-particulars." This is a continuous and dynamic process, acknowledging the complexity and multiplicity of contemporary experiences that resist static classification.

In sum, this "sorting" subjectivity represents a complex, dynamic cognitive process that is at once creative and critical, imposing order on the chaos of sensory input while constantly negotiating with the unsortable aspects of existence. It is a philosophical construct that encapsulates the many facets of human thought, reflecting the rich history of philosophical inquiry into the nature of understanding, existence, and the self.!!
