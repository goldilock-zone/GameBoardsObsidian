Movement philosophy proposes a sense of exploration of the inherent flux of the world through specified and sometimes unspecified groundings - either as constraints or as underpinnings.

Movement of multiple kinds has been constant in game-boards - literally, figuratively, formally, and diegetically. Surprisingly, this ever-present feature has received no formal attention - outside of what it does to the game-board as an artifact. This art-historical and design formalism lens to look at the game-boards has overlooked the immanent potential of the game-board as bodies and as sites that can spore futures.

**SPECIES OF MOVEMENT IN ARISTOTLE:**
For Aristotle, movement (kinesis) is not only local movement (local movement as in the displacement of entities over time); movement is change, and local movement is only one of the species of movement, alongside the others - The other species of movement he suggests are generation, corruption, and alteration. Alteration is also a mutation. When we go back to this notion of movement, as it happens within entities, we are able to track the movements that are the true cause of external transformations. Indie-futuring means to weave across the multiple species of movement and track the transformation of bodies, spaces, and events. This kind of relational worlding can offer an alternative to teleological becomings that propel the linear imagination of the worlds. These entangled interspecies of movement become the plane of entanglement, which is nothing other than the Erosphere.

**Relational worlding:**
According to Erin Manning, our sense of self and other emerges from processes of bodying and relational movement (becoming oneself by moving in relation to the world).

In game-boards, we know that the players move from the beginning to the end. They use the artifacts specific to each board and each game; the rules of each game determine the kind of movement the players will make. At the same time, the game-board itself becomes the site where the rules of movement find a formal resolution. Our project takes cognizance of these determinants of movement on either side of the game-boards and then turns its focus onto what happens in-between these determinants. What escapes the rules of movement before it becomes the formal logic on the game-board? What spaces of the game-boards have escaped the scrutiny of the rules that govern its spatialities? How do the bodies that navigate these movements defy the acceptable forms of moving through and thereby inform new forms of moving with the game boards? How do the bodies change when they move with the game-boards? When all these transformations happen, as they have been already happening through the ages, how do we see the game-boards new, for the first time when we see them for the millionth time? What capacity does this sense of wonder carry to color imaginations for what is possible?

**WHEN WE LOOK AT GAME-BOARDS, WE ARE SAYING  THAT THEY ARE GAME-WORLDS… WHAT IS ALLOWING US TO SAY THAT? WHAT DO WE SEE IN THE GAME-BOARDS THAT ACTIVATE THEM AS WORLDS?**

**Bodies, materiality, spatiality,**

Game boards are objects, artifacts, relatively stable in their game-play environment and ability to host the play.

**From bodies to bodying as an indie-futuring technique**

Bodies here are not understood as things or objects that are fully formed but rather as devices, processes, and machines that are making the world as they move through the world in a relational manner. Indie-futuring then does not work with any forms of disembodiment, but just the opposite. To indie-future a world means to pursue the bodying of all the more-than-versions of the body as it makes itself and the world in a mutually relational space. It is a practice of multi-bodiment.

But there is no bodying without movement. So indie-futuring the worlds also means to move through the world across networks of micro and macro movements. It invites the study of body-in-movement as “the knowing self [which] is never finished, whole, simply there and original (…) able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another” (Haraway, 1988, p. 586). This relational perspective on movement relates to Goffman’s (1978) research into how selves are constructed through their performative interactions with objects and persons, and to Blumer’s (1969) description of how meanings of self and others are made in interaction. We extend Goffman’s (1978) and Blumer’s (1969) constructivist approaches, inviting an understanding of the body as an emergent relational happening. We draw our epistemic inspiration from Donna Haraway’s notion of “apparatus of bodily production” (Haraway, 1991) which points to how things and bodies—material bodies, semiotic devices, and discursive tools—are always in relational becoming. We also build upon the enactive approach that situates the emergence of embodied experiences in a relational sensorimotor loop between an agent and the world she engages with (Varela et al., 1991) together with others (De Jaegher and Di Paolo, 2007; Fuchs and De Jaegher, 2009).

We speculate that if bodying emerges through relational movement then abilities and disabilities, cognitive and body norms and deviations can be approached through the understanding of the qualities and properties of relational movement. In other words, what has been perceived as a “faulty” or “broken” body might be approached as a relational mismatch. The relational perspective in disability studies understands dis/ability as a relationship between an impairment and environment (Moser, 2006; Shakespeare, 2014; Goodley, 2017).

**Topologies - How do we map**
**INTENSITIES:**
Existing intensities to propel movement through the body
Existing intensities to culminate movement through the body
Immanent points of intensities at points of movement intersections
To map these:
We need three different kinds of points and three different kinds of connections
Itineraries through landscapes
DETERRITORIALIZATION
POINTS OF BEGINNING
POINTS OF END
POINTS OF INTERSECTION
RETERRITORIALIZATION
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BEGINNINGS
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ENDS
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INTERSECTIONS

**YET ANOTHER STRUCTURE FOR INDIE-FUTURISMS:**

How do characters of futures become bodies that become agents of indie-futures?
How do settings for futures become topologies become fecund planes of indie-futures?
How do mobilities in futures become movements become an incipient flux in indie-futures?
How do tools/technologies in futures become materialities become _______ in indie-futures?
How do behaviors for futures become values become ______ for indie-futures?
