As previously stated, the Mughals were great fans of the game of Chaupar. Mughal emperor Akbar was so addicted to the game that he laid up a vast "board" in flagstones in the courtyard of his palace at Fatehpur Sikri, where he and his courtiers played it with slaves as the playing pieces. In addition, Akbar made certain changes to the game. Some of them were betting-related, such as "If an opponent's four pieces are Pukhta, but he loses his bet, the other players are entitled to double the amount of debt." He was such a big fan of the game that he allegedly invented his own version called chandal mandal, which had sixteen arms and could be played in at least twelve different ways with super-long dice. Following Akbar, Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysore experimented with pachisi in six, eight, ten, and twelve arm versions, as well as a hybrid pachisi/snake and ladder game played on a four-armed board, where inscribed squares send the players backwards and forwards in a cosmic cycle of birth and rebirth.
